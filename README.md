<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
Third-year Computer Science student and former educator turned developer with a proven track record of building internal tools, streamlining workflows, and driving automation in enterprise environments. Currently working as an Information Systems Specialist, where I bridge technical execution and operational needs—designing systems that improve efficiency, usability, and team collaboration.

My background in teaching shaped my ability to break down complex systems, communicate clearly with stakeholders, and build solutions that truly serve users. I thrive when I’m building practical tools, designing clean interfaces, and working on teams that value mentorship, innovation, and real-world impact.

Now actively seeking a full stack internship or junior developer role where I can grow under experienced engineers and contribute to projects that make a difference.
I’m especially passionate about:

UI/UX in games and ed tech

Projects that make a real-world impact

The intersection of software and environmental data science

Let’s connect if you’re building something meaningful and need someone who can blend communication, creativity, and code.
